When an actor egg file is created, some optimization occurs and the model hierarchy is hidden from view. While normally this optimization is a good thing, if you want to change textures on a specific part of the model (for example, just a character's face) you will need access to this geometry hiearchy. This is where egg-optchar.exe is helpful again. Egg-optchar allows you to rename, duplicate character joints and perform other functions on a model with a skeleton.  See [[Actor Manipulations]] for more information.</p>

<p>
To be able to make the geometry visible as a node in the resulting model, you can use the following option:

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>-flag <name of geometry part in original model>=<desired name of part in Panda3D></td>
  </tr>
</table>

A specific example:

<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>egg-optchar -flag face=face char_model.egg</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>
<b class = "code"> "-flag *=*"</b> will keep all geometry named as they were in the original model.
</p>

Now to swap textures in Panda3D you just need to find that geomnode, in our case suppose it's "face":
<table class="code">
  <tr>
    <td>actorName.actor.find("**/face").setTexture(newTexture,1)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


</p>
