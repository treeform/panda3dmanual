The following sample code loads up an environment, puts the camera in
the center of it, and generates the six faces of a cube map from the
point of view of the camera:

<table class="code"><tr><td><pre>
scene = loader.loadModel('bvw-f2004--streetscene/street-scene.egg')
scene.reparentTo(render)
scene.setZ(-2)
base.saveCubeMap('streetscene_cube_#.jpg', size = 256)
</pre></td></tr></table>

These are the six faces generated:

Right:

Left:

[[Image:Streetscene cube 1.jpg]]

Front:

[[Image:Streetscene cube 2.jpg]]

Back:

[[Image:Streetscene cube 3.jpg]]

Top:

[[Image:Streetscene cube 4.jpg]]

Bottom:

[[Image:Streetscene cube 5.jpg]]

And when they are assembled into a cube map, it looks like this:

Or, when we apply that cube map to a sphere, you can see there are
absolutely no seams between the edges:
