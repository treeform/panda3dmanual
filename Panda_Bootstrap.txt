Though Panda3D is easy enough, it needs some getting used to before you can understand the manuals and examples.

Here are a few links, which should make understanding Panda3D easier:

<ul>
<li> http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/29/
This link gives you a very broad overview of panda, which is helpful to more clearly understand the Introductory examples.
<li> http://www.etc.cmu.edu/bvw/scripting/index.html (Note, currently not functional with Panda3D-1.1.0)<br>
Read this example once you are done with the introduction example following this section. I found referring to the manual helpful and informative while working on this example.
<li> The samples that come with the installation are also very informative and well commented. They should be really helpful for people new to Panda3D.
<li> Have the Panda3D and BVW quick references handy while you are coding.
<li>http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20040128/goslin_pfv.htm A  postmortem of ToonTown built with Panda3D.
</ul>

Having the API reference handy while reading the manual is also advisable, as the manual is lacking explanations at times.
