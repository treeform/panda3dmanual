<h2>MopathInterval</h2>

Motion paths are an advanced feature of Panda3D, and they are discussed later. Still, motion paths have their own intervals. A motion path interval is much like a function interval in that there are no additional parameters other than the motion path and the NodePath it is affecting.

<code python>
intervalName = MopathInterval("Motion Path Name", NodePath, "Interval Name")
</code>

<h2>ParticleInterval</h2>

Particle effects can be run from inside intervals as well:

<code python>
intervalName = ParticleInterval(
    "Particle Effect Name",
    parent,
    worldRelative = 1,
    loop = 0 or 1,
    duration = myDuration
)
</code>
