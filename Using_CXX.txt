Though Panda3D is often used with Python, it is possible to program a complete game in C++ without any line of Python.
To start a C++ project, rebuilding Panda3D from source is not needed. This is done by including the right headers and linking with the right libraries.

This section will explain how to use C++ to create your Panda3D programs instead of the default Python language.

The manual and the API are mainly focused at the use of Python, so you will need to keep a few things in mind:
*You need to include the file <i>pandabase.h</i>, which is needed to initialize the Panda3D library.
*There's no DirectStart. You need to create windows yourself using the [[The Window Framework|Window Framework]].
*You can import the classes you need just by including their header file, like this:
:<pre class="codeblock">#import "textNode.h"</pre>
*The functions are called the same way, but in lowercase and spaces between the words.
:So <i>instanceTo()</i> in Python becomes <i>instance_to()</i> in C++.
