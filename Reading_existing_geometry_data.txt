You can fairly easily extract and examine or operate on the vertices
for an existing model, although you should be aware that the
<em>order</em> in which the vertices appear in a model is undefined.
There is no correlation between the order in which vertices are listed
in an egg file, and the order in which they will appear in the
resulting loaded model.  Panda may rearrange the vertices, or even add
or remove vertices, as needed to optimize the model for rendering
performance.  Even from one session to the next, the vertices might
come out in a different order.

This does make certain kinds of vertex operations difficult; if you
plan to write code that expects to encounter the vertices of a model
in a particular order, we recommend you build up those vertices
yourself using a [[More about GeomVertexReader, GeomVertexWriter, and GeomVertexRewriter|GeomVertexWriter]] (as described in [[Creating and filling a GeomVertexData]]), so that you have explicit control over the vertex order.

However, if you have no need to operate on the vertices in any
particular order, or if you just want to casually browse the vertices
in a model, feel free to use the following instructions to read the
data.

When you load a model, you have a handle to the root node of
the model, which is usually a <b>ModelRoot</b> node.  The geometry itself
will be stored in a series of [[GeomNode|<b>GeomNodes</b>]], which will be children of the
root node.  In order to examine the vertex data, you must visit the
GeomNodes in the model.  One way to do this is to walk through all the
GeomNodes like this:

<pre class="codeblock">
geomNodeCollection = model.findAllMatches('**/+GeomNode')
for nodePath in geomNodeCollection.asList():
  geomNode = nodePath.node()
  processGeomNode(geomNode)
</pre>

Once you have a particular GeomNode, you must walk through the list of
[[Geom|<b>Geoms</b>]] stored on that node.  Each Geom also has an associated
RenderState, which controls the visible appearance of that Geom
(e.g. texture, backfacing, etc.).

<pre class="codeblock">
def processGeomNode(geomNode):
  for i in range(geomNode.getNumGeoms()):
    geom = geomNode.getGeom(i)
    state = geomNode.getGeomState(i)
    print geom
    print state
    processGeom(geom)
</pre>

Note that geomNode.getGeom() is only appropriate if you will be
reading, but not modifying, the data.  If you intend to modify the
geom data in any way (including any nested data like vertices or
primitives), you should use geomNode.modifyGeom() instead.

Each Geom has an associated [[GeomVertexData|<b>GeomVertexData</b>]], and one or more
[[GeomPrimitive|<b>GeomPrimitives</b>]].  Some GeomVertexData objects may be shared by more
than one Geom, especially if you have used flattenStrong() to optimize
a model.

<pre class="codeblock">
def processGeom(geom):
  vdata = geom.getVertexData()
  print vdata
  processVertexData(vdata)
  for i in range(geom.getNumPrimitives()):
    prim = geom.getPrimitive(i)
    print prim
    processPrimitive(prim, vdata)
</pre>

As above, getVertexData() is only appropriate if you will only be
reading, but not modifying, the vertex data.  Similarly,
getPrimitive() is appropriate only if you will not be modifying the
primitive index array.  If you intend to modify either one, use
modifyVertexData() or modifyPrimitive(), respectively.

You can use the [[More about GeomVertexReader, GeomVertexWriter, and GeomVertexRewriter|<b>GeomVertexReader</b>]] class to examine the vertex data.
You should create a GeomVertexReader for each column of the data you
intend to read.  It is up to you to ensure that a given column exists
in the vertex data before you attempt to read it (you can use
vdata.hasColumn() to test this).

<pre class="codeblock">
def processVertexData(vdata):
  vertex = GeomVertexReader(vdata, 'vertex')
  texcoord = GeomVertexReader(vdata, 'texcoord')
  while not vertex.isAtEnd():
    v = vertex.getData3f()
    t = texcoord.getData2f()
    print "v = %s, t = %s" % (repr(v), repr(t))
</pre>

Each GeomPrimitive may be any of a handful of different classes,
according to the primitive type it is; but all GeomPrimitive classes
have the same common interface to walk through the list of vertices
referenced by the primitives stored within the class.

You can use the setRow() method of GeomVertexReader to set the reader
to a particular vertex.  This affects the next call to getData().  In
this way, you can extract the vertex data for the vertices in the
order that the primitive references them (instead of in order from the
beginning to the end of the vertex table, as above).

<pre class="codeblock">
def processPrimitive(prim, vdata):
  vertex = GeomVertexReader(vdata, 'vertex')

  prim = prim.decompose()

  for p in range(prim.getNumPrimitives()):
    s = prim.getPrimitiveStart(p)
    e = prim.getPrimitiveEnd(p)
    for i in range(s, e):
      vi = prim.getVertex(i)
      vertex.setRow(vi)
      v = vertex.getData3f()
      print "prim %s has vertex %s: %s" % (p, vi, repr(v))
    print
</pre>

You may find the call to prim.decompose() useful (as shown in the
above example).  This call automatically decomposes higher-order
primitive types, like GeomTristrips and GeomTrifans, into the
equivalent component primitive types, like GeomTriangles; but when called on a GeomTriangles, it returns the GeomTriangles object unchanged.  Similarly,
GeomLinestrips will be decomposed into GeomLines.  This way you can
write code that doesn't have to know anything about GeomTristrips and
GeomTrifans, which are fairly complex; it can assume it will only get
the much simpler GeomTriangles (or, in the case of lines or points,
GeomLines and GeomPoints, respectively).
