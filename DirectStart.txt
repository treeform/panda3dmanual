<h2>An overview of DirectStart</h2>

If you are already up to speed with Python, the following code may look like a black box:

<pre class="codeblock">
import direct.directbase.DirectStart
run()
</pre>

This section provide some key details on the function of this import statement.

DirectStart creates an instance of the class [http://panda3d.net/apiref.php?page=ShowBase ShowBase], which itself inherits DirectObject. Under Linux, the relevant file can be found:

<pre class="codeblock">/usr/share/panda3d/direct/showbase/</pre>

On Windows, the code is (by default) located in:

<pre class="codeblock">C:\Panda3D-1.X.X\direct\src\showbase</pre>

An important item created meanwhile is a base task manager as <code>taskMgr</code>. The function <code>run()</code> is in fact a single call to launch this task manager. 

<H4>Apparent global variables created</H4>
Some key variables used in all Panda3D scripts are actually attributes of the ShowBase instance. Here is the relevant code making these attribute global in scope:

<pre class="codeblock">
        __builtin__.base = self
        __builtin__.render2d = self.render2d
        __builtin__.aspect2d = self.aspect2d
        __builtin__.render = self.render
        __builtin__.hidden = self.hidden
        __builtin__.camera = self.camera
        __builtin__.loader = self.loader
        __builtin__.taskMgr = self.taskMgr
        __builtin__.jobMgr = self.jobMgr
        __builtin__.eventMgr = self.eventMgr
        __builtin__.messenger = self.messenger
        __builtin__.bboard = self.bboard
        __builtin__.run = self.run
        __builtin__.ostream = Notify.out()
        __builtin__.directNotify = directNotify
        __builtin__.giveNotify = giveNotify
        __builtin__.globalClock = globalClock
        __builtin__.vfs = vfs
        __builtin__.cpMgr = ConfigPageManager.getGlobalPtr()
        __builtin__.cvMgr = ConfigVariableManager.getGlobalPtr()
        __builtin__.pandaSystem = PandaSystem.getGlobalPtr()
</pre>

This is where the commonly used objects base, render, render2d, camera, messenger, taskMgr are created. There are more such variables added to __builtin__. Consult the code if you want to find them all. 

Note that this way of exposing these attributes make them available globaly even though these will not be returned by a call to the built-in function <code>dir()</code>.
