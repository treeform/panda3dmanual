This page describes potential build issues that may arise when building Panda3D using the PPremake build system on the Linux platform, and possible solutions.

<h2>Undeclared 'vector_string'</h2>

If you compile Panda3D 1.5.3 using ppremake, you might get this error:
<pre class="codeblock">filename.h:136: error: ‘vector_string’ has not been declared</pre>
This error occurs because some header files in the "ppremake" directory were accidentally truncated in the 1.5.3 source.
This bug has been fixed in 1.5.4. If you still want to compile on 1.5.3, you will need to grab a newer version of the "ppremake" directory from CVS, for example using this command:
<pre class="codeblock">rm -rf ppremake
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@panda3d.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/panda3d checkout -A -r panda3d_1_5_4 ppremake</pre>
Make sure you have cd'ed to the root of the source tree before executing those commands.
