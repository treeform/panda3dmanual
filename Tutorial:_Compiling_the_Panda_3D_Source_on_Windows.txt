<b>Note:</b> The information below applies to Panda3D 1.6.0 and later. Versions before that use Visual C++ 2005.

=Compiling Panda3D on Windows=

==Step 1: Installing the Requirements==

If you don't have it already, download and install Visual C++ from:

http://www.microsoft.com/express/2008/

If you have the Express version and not the full version, you will need to download and install the Microsoft Platform SDK. This version is the only one I found that includes ATL (which is required):

Next download and install the DirectX SDK from:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C72D9F1E-53F3-4747-8490-6801D8E8B4EF&displaylang=en

If all goes well you are all set to use makepanda to compile panda.

==Step 2: Download the source==
Download the latest version of the Panda 3D source available at:

http://panda3d.org/download.php

Extract to an easily accessible place on your HDD (example: C:\panda_source)

==Step 3: Open a command prompt==
Easiest way is:
START->RUN and type cmd, hit ok.

You will now have a command prompt open.

You will most likely be in the C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name> folder.

Type: <code>cd C:\panda_source</code>

This command cd "change directory" changes the directory to C:\panda_source

Type: <code>makepanda\makepanda.bat</code>

This brings up all the command options for makepanda.bat

==Step 4: "The simplest way to compile panda is to just type..."==
As the help text says:

Type: <code>makepanda\makepanda.bat --everything</code>

This process will take an hour or so, so it is best to go do something else because your comp will be using most of its resources on compiling.

For more information on using the makepanda tool to compile, please read the [http://panda3d.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/%2Acheckout%2A/panda3d/doc/doc/INSTALL-MK INSTALL-MK] document, which is also available within the doc directory of your source tree.

<b>Alternative way:</b> In the directory "makepanda", you will find a "makepanda.sln" file. If you open it, it should launch the Visual Studio environment, you can also compile Panda3D from within there. Internally, this just invokes the makepanda script. If you use this method instead, be sure to set the build configuration to "Release" (unless you want a debug build of course.)

==Step 5: Make an installer==

<b>Note:</b> If you've used the .sln file to build Panda, and used "Release" mode, the installer .exe has already been created for you.

Type: <code>makepanda\makepanda.bat --everything --installer</code>

This should take much less time because if you notice there will be a "built" folder in your C:\panda_source, this was created in the previous step.
If you've used different compile options than just --everything in the previous step, make sure those options are the same in this step.

==Conclusion==
And that's it. Depending on your needs you can configure Panda3D any way you wish.
