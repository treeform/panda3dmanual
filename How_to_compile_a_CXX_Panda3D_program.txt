[cxx]This short guide explains how to compile and run a Panda3D game written in C++.
If you use Python for your Panda3D programs, you can skip this section.


On UNIX, it is a very good possibility that you can compile using the g++ compiler. The following page describes how to do that:
* [[How to build a CXX Panda3D game on Linux|Linux version]]

On Windows, compiling using g++ will not work. It is however possible to compile your Panda3D project using the MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 C++) compiler.  The following page describes how to do that:
* [[How_to_build_a_CXX_Panda3D_game_using_Microsoft_Visual_Studio_2008|MSVC version]]

Some have also managed to build Panda3D under OSX. This is the related forum thread:
