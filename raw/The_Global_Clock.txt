The global clock is an instance of the [http://panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=ClockObject ClockObject] class. It gets imported into the global namespace when you load the DirectStart/Showbase modules.

To get the time (in seconds) since the last frame was drawn:
<pre class="codeblock">
globalClock.getDt()
</pre>

Another useful function is the frame time (in seconds, since the program started):
<pre class="codeblock">
globalClock.getFrameTime()
</pre>
