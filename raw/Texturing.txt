At its simplest, texturing merely consists of applying a texture in your modeling program.  When you export the model, pay attention to the relative path between the egg file you create, and the image files.  That relative path is encoded into the egg file.  When panda attempts to load the egg file, it will look in the same position relative to the egg file.  Panda can load JPG, PNG, TIF, and a number of other file formats.

More advanced texturing methods are described in the sections that follow.
