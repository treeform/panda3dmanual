== Summary ==

A GeomVertexWriter is used to write to a [[GeomVertexData]] object, which contains data on the actual position of vertices used within a [[Geom]].

== GeomVertexWriter ==

There are two lines of GeomVertexWriter: with or without a qp prefix.  The qp prefixed versions are the current versions, and will be described here.

The qpGeomVertexWriter class provides a high-level interface for quickly writing a sequence of numeric values from a vertex table. 

This object can be used both to replace existing vertices in the table, or to extend the table with new vertices.  The set_data*() family of methods can only be used to replace existing data; it is an error to allow these to run past the end of the data.  The add_data*() family of methods, on the other hand, can be used to replace existing data or add new data; if you call set_row() into the middle of existing data the add_data*() methods will behave like the corresponding set_data*(), but if they run past the end of existing data they will quietly add new vertices.

Like GeomVertexReader, the writer is particularly optimized for writing a single column of data values for a series of vertices, without changing columns between each number.  Although you can also use one GeomVertexWriter to write across the columns if it is convenient, by calling set_column() repeatedly at each vertex, it is faster to write down the columns, and to use a different GeomVertexWriter for each column.

Note that, like a GeomVertexReader, a GeomVertexWriter does not keep a reference count to the actual vertex data buffer.  This means that it is important not to keep a GeomVertexWriter object around over a long period of time in which the data buffer is likely to be deallocated; it is intended for making a quick pass over the data in one session.

It also means that you should create any GeomVertexWriters *before* creating GeomVertexReaders on the same data, since the writer itself might cause the vertex buffer to be deallocated.  Better yet, use a GeomVertexRewriter if you are going to create both of them anyway.
