==Color Write Masks==

Color write masks enable you to block writes to the Red, Green, Blue, or Alpha channels of the framebuffer.  This is not a frequently-used capability, but it
does have a few applications:

* When using red-blue 3D glasses, you might want to render the red image, then the blue image.  (In fact, Panda uses this technique automatically when you set <span class="code">red-blue-stereo 1</span> in your Config.prc file.)

* Battletech Battle Pods connect 3 black-and-white monitors to a single R,G,B video card output (really!)  With the help of color write masks, you could update an individual monitor.

* Sometimes, one wants to store data in the alpha-channel of the framebuffer. Using a color mask can avoid accidentally overwriting that data.

Using a color write-mask is not free.  During normal rendering, each pixel written to the frame buffer requires a memory write.  With a color-mask active, a memory read-modify-write cycle is needed, which is more expensive.

By default, color write masks are off.

==Turning on the Color Mask==

To enable writes to all the channels of the framebuffer, use this:

<pre class="codeblock">
bits = ColorWriteAttrib.CAlpha
bits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CRed
bits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CGreen
bits |= ColorWriteAttrib.CBlue
nodePath.setAttrib(ColorWriteAttrib.make(bits))
</pre>

To disable writes to one or more channels, omit that bit.  You can also use:

<pre class="codeblock">
nodePath.setAttrib(ColorWriteAttrib.make(ColorWriteAttrib.CAll))
</pre>

To enable all bits.
