If you have too many nodes/meshes in your scene, this might result in slow performance. You can check your Geom count in [[PStats]], or by calling <code>NodePath.analyze()</code> on your object or scene.

Panda3D provides a function to reduce the mesh count: NodePath.flattenStrong(). This will reduce the NodePath to only one node. Be careful with this function: Usage without care might cause your game to crash, since you will not be able to move individual subnodes of a flattened node around anymore.

NodePath.flattenMedium() and flattenLight() are not as rigorous NodePath.flattenStrong(), but may be worth considering.

Though, if you have multiple independently-moving rigid nodes, the flattening functions might not suit your needs, because, since the flattening functions flatten everything to one node you won't be able to move individual sub-nodes around. An alternative is [[the Rigid Body Combiner]], which can combine multiple nodes while you can still change the transforms on the sub-nodes.

If you are using the [[GeoMipTerrain]] for terrain rendering, that might also result in a large mesh count. (You can check the block count by calling <code>terrain.getRoot().analyze()</code>.) If it is too high, try increasing the block size, or enable AutoFlattening, which will reduce the block count to only one. The autoflatten function was created because normally you can't flatten a terrain using the normal flattenX methods, because this will interfere with the GeoMipTerrain's updating system.
