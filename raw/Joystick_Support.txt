While Panda3D has mouse and keyboard support, it is best to look to the open source community for joystick support. Pygame is an open-source module that contains joystick support that may be easily included into a Panda3D application. Pygame may be found at [http://www.pygame.org http://www.pygame.org].

After downloading pygame, simply import the modules as you would any Panda3D module.

<pre class="codeblock">import pygame</pre>

Once pygame is imported, it needs to be initialized. Also, when the program is through with using pygame, it should be exited cleanly.

<pre class="codeblock">
pygame.init()
pygame.quit() 
</pre>

Also, the joystick should be initialized. It too has a quit function.

<pre class="codeblock">
joystick.init()
joystick.quit()
</pre>

From here, it is possible to get the axis information of the joystick as well as the state of the buttons.

<pre class="codeblock">
# Consume PyGame events.
# This seems superfluous, but it is necessary.
# Otherwise get_axis and get_button don't work.
for e in pygame.event.get(): pass

joystick.get_axis(<Axis>)
joystick.get_button(<Button>)
</pre>

These are the primary functions for the joystick, but there are a number of other functions available for joystick support. This can be found at the pygame website.
