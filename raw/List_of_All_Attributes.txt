==List of All Attributes==

The following is a concise list of all the RenderAttribs supported by Panda3D. Additional documentation can be found by clicking on the name of the RenderAttrib.

*<b>[[Alpha Testing|AlphaTestAttrib]]</b>: Hides part of the model, based on the texture's alpha channel.

*<b>[[Antialiasing|AntialiasAttrib]]</b>: Controls full-screen antialiasing and polygon-edge antialiasing.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|AudioVolumeAttrib]]</b>: Applies a scale to audio volume for positional sounds.

*<b>[[Auxiliary Bitplane Control|AuxBitplaneAttrib]]</b>: Causes shader generator to produce extra data.

*<b>[[Clip Planes|ClipPlaneAttrib]]</b>: Slices off a piece of the model, using a clipping plane.

*<b>[[Tinting and Recoloring|ColorAttrib]]</b>: Tints the model.  Only works if the model is not illuminated.

*<b>[[Transparency and Blending|ColorBlendAttrib]]</b>: This specifies how colors are blended into the frame buffer, for special effects.

*<b>[[Tinting and Recoloring|ColorScaleAttrib]]</b>: Modulates vertex colors with a flat color.

*<b>[[Color Write Masks|ColorWriteAttrib]]</b>: Causes the model to not affect the R, G, B, or A channel of the framebuffer.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|CullBinAttrib]]</b>: Controls the order in which Panda renders geometry.

*<b>[[Backface Culling and Frontface Culling|CullFaceAttrib]]</b>: Causes backfaces or frontfaces of the model to be visible.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|DepthOffsetAttrib]]</b>: Causes the Z-buffer to treat the object as if it were closer or farther.

*<b>[[Depth Test and Depth Write|DepthTestAttrib]]</b>: Alters the way the Z-buffer affects the model.

*<b>[[Depth Test and Depth Write|DepthWriteAttrib]]</b>: Controls whether or not the model affects the Z-buffer.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|DrawMaskAttrib]]</b>: Controls which cameras can see which objects.

*<b>[[Fog|FogAttrib]]</b>: Causes the model to be obscured by fog if it is far from the camera.

*<b>[[Lighting|LightAttrib]]</b>: Causes the model to be illuminated by certain lights.

*<b>[[Light Ramps|LightRampAttrib]]</b>: Enables HDR tone mapping or cartoon shading.

*<b>[[Materials|MaterialAttrib]]</b>: Changes the way the model reflects light.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|RenderModeAttrib]]</b>: Used to enable wireframe rendering.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|RescaleNormalAttrib]]</b>: Can disable the automatic correction of non-unit normals.

*<b>[[#Undocumented|ShadeModelAttrib]]</b>: Can cause the model to appear faceted instead of smooth.

*<b>[[Pixel and Vertex Shaders|ShaderAttrib]]</b>: Gives almost unlimited control, but difficult to use.

*<b>[[Stencil Test/Write Attribute|StencilAttrib]]</b>: Causes the model to affect the stencil buffer, or be affected by the stencil buffer.

*<b>[[Automatic Texture Coordinates|TexGenAttrib]]</b>: Causes the system to synthesize texture coordinates for the model.

*<b>[[Texture Transforms|TexMatrixAttrib]]</b>: Alters the existing texture coordinates.

*<b>[[Texturing|TextureAttrib]]</b>: Applies a texture map to the model.

*<b>[[Transparency and Blending|TransparencyAttrib]]</b>: Causes the model to be partially transparent.


==Undocumented==

Unfortunately, the Panda3D manual is still a work in progress: there are many aspects of it that are not fully documented yet.  These attributes are not yet documented:

AudioVolumeAttrib, CullBinAttrib, DepthOffsetAttrib, DrawMaskAttrib, RenderModeAttrib, RescaleNormalAttrib, ShadeModelAttrib

However, although the manual does not document these classes,
the [http://panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=classes Reference] documentation does.
