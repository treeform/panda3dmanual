Collision detection allows for two objects to bump into each other and react.  This includes not only sending messages for events, but also to keep the objects from passing through each other.  Collision detection is a very powerful tool for immersion, but it is somewhat complex.

There are two ways to go about collision detection.  One is to create special collision geometry, such as spheres and polygons, to determine collisions.  The other is to allow collisions against all geometry.  While the first is somewhat more complex and takes more effort to implement, it is much faster to execute and is a better long-term solution.  For quick-and-dirty applications, though, collision with geometry can be a fine solution.

This section of the manual will address both methods.
