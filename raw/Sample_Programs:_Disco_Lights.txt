<b>Explanation</b>

This sample program demonstrates lighting in panda. Lighting in panda can add a lot of depth into a scene. In panda, you can create point, directional, ambient and spot lights(for a detailed description of these lights, see the manual link below). Note that lights in panda will not cast shadows. They can create a dark and light side of an object but they cannot cast shadows from one object to another or onto the same object. Panda lights also act on object vertices only. The more polygons an object has, the more detailed the lighting will be on it. For more information on lighting, please consult the Panda3D online manual.
