If you have already installed panda previously, you
should uninstall it before installing a new version.
Once your machine is clean of all previous versions
of panda, you should download the windows
installer from the [http://panda3d.org/download.php download] page.
Run the installer, and follow the prompts:

<br><br>

After installing panda, you should run the sample programs to verify
that the installation is good.  Under Windows, the easiest way to run
a sample program is to find it in the Start Menu:

<br><br>

But you can also run a sample program manually, using a command prompt.
It is a good idea to do so, since this is how you will run your own
programs, at least at first.

Open a command prompt, then change directory to the location where you
installed panda.  Then, change to the samples subdirectory.
There, you will find a large number of samples:

Change directory into one of the sample program directories, then use
python to run the sample program in question:

If the test programs don't run, then usually, you need to update
your video drivers.  If you want to know exactly why a program didn't run,
you may need to run it using the command prompt - this will enable you
to see the error messages.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i>
<br>display(error): The application requested harware acceleration, but your OpenGL
<br>display(error): driver, GDI Generic, only supports software rendering.
<br>display(error): You need to install a hardware-accelerated OpenGL driver, or,
<br>display(error): if you actually *want* to use a software renderer, then
<br>display(error): alter the hardware/software configuration in your Config.prc file.
<br>display(error): Window wouldn't open; abandoning window.
</i>

This error is fairly self-explanatory: it means your video drivers are inadequate.  Obtain better drivers.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i><br>python is not a recognised internal command</i>

This error message means that the command prompt was not able to locate
python.  Normally, during the panda installation process,
the PATH environment variable is configured to indicate the location of
python.  However, some PCs have unusual security configurations that
prevent the installer from modifying the PATH.  This can result in the
error message shown above.  

To solve this problem, it may be necessary to modify the PATH manually. Click on the "My Computer" icon on your desktop and select Properties. Choose the tab "Advanced".  Click the Button "Environnment Variables":

If you have administrator access to the PC, select the PATH line in the list under System Variables, otherwise, select the PATH line in the list of personal environment Variables.

Now double click the PATH (or Path) line. a small window opens containing a series of directories separated by semicolons.  Add Panda3D's bin and python directories to the end of the PATH.

It may be necessary to log off and log back in to obtain the updated settings.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i><br>Warning: DirectNotify: category 'Interval' already exists</i>

This error is of no consequence.  Ignore it.
