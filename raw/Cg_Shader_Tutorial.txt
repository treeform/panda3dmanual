<h2>Cg Shader Tutorials</h2>

Panda has the ability to process shaders written in the Cg shader language. In this tutorial series, you will learn how to write shaders for Panda in Cg. While there are panda specific things in this tutorial you should be able to learn how to write Cg shaders that can be used in other engines.

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

You should be able to write a simple math program in C/C++ or C#. Do not underestimate this. If you start writing your own shaders without any prior knowledge about a C like language it is as hard as starting to write a Panda3D application without knowing anything about Python. Some resources you might want to look at:

*[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming C# Programming Wikibook]

You should have a solid grasp of Panda basics. Read [[A Panda %22Hello World%22 using Python | the hello world]] tutorial and understand the "Solar System" sample that comes with the panda distribution. You should also have a good understanding of how the [[The_Scene_Graph | scene graph]] works. If you're interested in writing a shadow mapping shader, it helps to have a solid understanding of how the [[Depth_Test_and_Depth_Write | depth buffer]] works.

Read the first chapter from [http://http.developer.nvidia.com/CgTutorial/cg_tutorial_chapter01.html NVIDIA's Cg Tutorial]. You do not have to understand it fully, but at least you know who invented Cg and what it is for. The [http://developer.nvidia.com NVIDIA] and [http://developer.amd.com ATI] developer sites also have plenty of useful information about shaders.

You should also have the [[List of Possible Shader Inputs]] page handy.
