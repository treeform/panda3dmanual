<b>The Carousel Sample Program</b>

To run a sample program, you need to install Panda3D. If you're a Windows user, you'll find the sample programs in your start menu. If you're a linux user, you'll find the sample programs in /usr/share/panda3d.

<b>Explanation</b>

This sample progam demonstrates some uses for intervals in panda to move objects in your panda world.

Intervals are built in Panda3D functions that will let you change an attribute over time. In this tutorial, the position and texture attributes of various objects will be altered over time to give life to a carousel. The most common intervals for doing simple movement of objects are the posInterval and hprInterval. These intervals will change the position/orientation of an object (or node) over a given time and given displacement/rotation, respectively. Another interval we will look at is the LerpFunc interval. LerpFunc will call a function and give it a linearly interpolated value range over a specified time range. This is how we will oscilate pandas via a sin wave and alternate textures over time. For more information on intervals, please refer to the intervals section of the online manual.
