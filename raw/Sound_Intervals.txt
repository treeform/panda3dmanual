See [[Loading and Playing Sounds and Music]] for basic information on how to load and play sounds.

Sound intervals play sounds from inside an interval. Like actor intervals, sound intervals have a loop parameter and the ability to be paused. Sound intervals also have volume and start time parameters.

<code python>
mySound = loader.loadSfx("mySound.wav")

myInterval = SoundInterval(
    mySound,
    loop = 0 or 1,
    duration = myDuration,
    volume = myVolume,
    startTime = myStartTime
)
</code>

The looping provided by the sound interval is not clean. There will be a pause between loops of roughly a tenth of a second.  See [[Manipulating Sounds]] for a better way to loop sounds.
