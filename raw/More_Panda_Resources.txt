<h2>Panda Specific Resources</h2>

[http://www.etc.cmu.edu/bvw/scripter.html  The BVW Panda Tutorials].  This site has the tutorials that are used in Carnegie Mellon's [http://www.etc.cmu.edu/bvw/  Building Virtual Worlds] class.

[http://alice.org/pandagallery/  Alice Gallery]. This site holds many of the models  created for use with [http://alice.org/  Alice] but exported into the .egg format. Be advised though, some of these models may not work properly.

<h2>Python Libraries</h2>

[http://www.pygame.org/wiki/about Pygame.] GNU LGPL. Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing games. It includes Python bindings for SDL. Recommended for joystick support. Sound support is a free alternative to FMOD, though not a as capable (no 3D stereo sound for instance) 

[http://psyco.sourceforge.net/ Psyco.] MIT-style license. Python JIT optimizer. Can often make Python code run <i>faster</i> than code written in C (on Intel compatible chips.) Panda3D is mostly written in C++, but usually programed in Python. If Python function calls become a bottleneck, try using Psyco.

[http://scipy.org/Weave Weave.] BSD-style license. The weave package allows the inclusion of C/C++ within Python code and is useful in accelerating Python code. Weave is a subpackage of scipy.

[http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ Twisted] MIT-style license. An event-driven networking framework.

<h2>Useful Tools</h2>

[http://www.blender3d.org/ Blender.] 3D modeling and animation. Extensible in Python. Very fast user interface. The [http://chicken-export.sourceforge.net/ chicken] egg exporter is available.

[http://www.gimp.org/index.html The GIMP.] A very capable free software raster image editor. Useful for converting image formats, creating and editing textures.

[http://www.swig.org/ SWIG.] A software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages including Python.
