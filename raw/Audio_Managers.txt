Sound effects and music in code are implemented as <code>AudioManager</code> objects. You can access these audio managers with the following code:

<code python>
sfxMgr = base.sfxManagerList[0]
musicMgr = base.musicManager
</code>

In <code>base</code>, <code>sfxManagerList</code> is a list of <code>AudioManager</code> objects intended to be used for sound effects, and <code>musicManager</code> is an <code>AudioManager</code> object intended to be used for music.

Each <code>AudioManager</code> object can have 16 different sounds cached at a given time. This value is actually set as the <code>audio-cache-limit</code> in the panda config.prc (found in your install directory) and can be changed.

There are times where either sound effects, music, or both should be disabled and later enabled. These commands affect entire categories of sounds. Passing True or False in the last 2 functions will disable or enable the respective groups.

<code python>
base.disableAllAudio()
base.enableAllAudio()
base.enableMusic(True)
base.enableSoundEffects(True)
</code>

Positional audio is implemented through a wrapper of these objects and is covered in the next section, [[3D Audio]].
