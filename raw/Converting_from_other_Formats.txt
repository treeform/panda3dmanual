There are several tools included with panda that can convert various file formats into egg file format:

<table class="code"><tr><td>
lwo2egg
<br>dxf2egg
<br>flt2egg
<br>vrml2egg
<br>x2egg
</td></tr></table>

Note that panda can load any of these file formats without conversion, doing so causes the conversion to occur at runtime. 

Also, be aware: many of these file formats are limited.  Most do not include bone or animation data.  Some do not store normals.  Currently the .x format is the only one of these that stores bones, joints and animations.
