This page will explain about Panda3D's smart Reference Counting system.

Some Panda3D classes use this system. You can check if such a class is Reference Counted by checking in the [http://panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=classes List of Classes] if it inherits from ReferenceCount.

Such classes, for example Texture, or TextNode, are created like this:
<code cxx>  //  Create the PointerTo object
PT(TextNode) myVar;
  // Assign a new TextNode to it
myVar = new TextNode("title");

  // Now, you can do with it what you want, treat it like a pointer:

myVar->set_text("I am a reference counted TextNode!");
</code>
