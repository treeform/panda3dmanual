Labels are like buttons, but they do not respond to mouse-clicks.  This means a DirectLabel is basically just a text string, and in that respect is similar to [[OnscreenText]], except that the DirectLabel integrates better with the rest of the DirectGUI system (and the constructor accepts more DirectGUI-like options).

If you are making a text label to appear on a DirectFrame or in conjunction with DirectGUI somehow, you should probably use a DirectLabel.  For all other uses of text, you would probably be better off using [[OnscreenText]] or a making a plain [[Text Node]] instead.

DirectLabel's only unique keyword can be used if you want to create a label with multiple states. If you set the value of activeState to a nonexistent state, the label will disappear, since the default state is undefined.
<center><table>
<tr><td><b>Keyword</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td><td><b>Value</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>activeState</td><td>The "active" or normal state of the label</td><td>Number</td></tr></table></center>
