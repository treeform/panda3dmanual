<b>Explanation</b>

This program shows how to use shadow maps in Panda3D.  This is a technique for
dynamic shadowing.  Unfortunately, Panda3D does not yet support doing this fully automatically, so some manual setup is needed to get dynamic shadows.  Adding
automatic dynamic shadows is high on the priority list of the Panda3D developers.
