The following program will generate and write out a 3-D texture to simulate woodgrain:

    that suggests woodgrain, with the grain running along the Z (W)
    direction.  Since there is not as much detail parallel to the
    grain as across it, the texture does not need to be as large in
    the Z dimension as in the other two dimensions.

    The woodgrain shape is perturbed with Perlin noise to make it more
    organic.  The parameters noiseScale and noiseZScale controls the
    frequency of the noise; larger numbers make smoother rings.  The
    parameter noiseAmp controls the effect of the noise; larger
    numbers make more dramatic distortions.

    ringScale controls the number of rings visible in the cross
    section of the texture.  A larger number makes more, denser rings.

The resulting images look like this:

[[Image:Woodgrain 0.jpg]]
[[Image:Woodgrain 1.jpg]]

[[Image:Woodgrain 3.jpg]]

To get consistent (over multiple runs of the programm) values from the PerlinNoise functions a seed value != 0 has to be used, seed values equal to 0 will randomize it<br>
The table_size is 256 by default.<br>
<br>
PerlinNoise3( scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, table_size, seed)<br>
PerlinNoise2( scaleX, scaleY, table_size, seed)<br>
PerlinNoise( table_size, seed )<br>
