The rendering process in Panda is comprised by four classes and their interactions: GraphicsPipe, GraphicsEngine, GraphicsStateGaurdian, and GraphicsOutput. The following sections will explain the purpose of each of these classes in detail.

Note that the following interfaces are for the advanced user only.  If you are writing a simple application that only needs to open a window and perform basic 3-D rendering, there is no need to use any of these interfaces, as the appropriate calls to open a default window are made automatically when you <code>import direct.directbase.DirectStart</code> at the start of your application.

At some point, however, you may wish to understand more deeply how to manage your windows and buffers, and to do this it will help you to understand how everything is connected together.
