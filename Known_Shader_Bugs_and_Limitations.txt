<b>Known Bugs in the Shader Subsystem</b>

Here is a list of known bugs, with workarounds:

<b>Problem: Register Allocation.</b>

<i>Problem:</i> nVidia's Cg compiler tries to assign registers to parameters.  Under a variety of circumstances, the Cg compiler will assign the same register to two parameters, or to a parameter and to a constant in the program.

<i>Workaround:</i> We have found that if you manually allocate registers by supplying a semantic string for each parameter, this problem is bypassed.

<b>Problem: Bad Target Languages.</b>

<i>Problem:</i> nVidia's Cg compiler will choose one of several different "target" languages to translate the Cg program into.  When the Cg compiler tries to translate the program into the VP40/FP40 language, it often produces incorrect output.

<i>Workaround:</i> We have discovered that translation into ARBVP1/ARBFP1 seems to work reliably.  Since that language is supported on essentially every video card, it is usually safe to translate into that language.  We have provided a config-variable that you can use to suppress bleeding edge stuff:

<pre class="codeblock">
basic-shaders-only #t
</pre>
This variable is enabled by default.

At some point, when functionality that is currently flaky becomes reliable,
we may expand the definition of what constitutes 'basic' shaders.

<b>Problem: Cg program too complex for driver.</b>

<i>Problem:</i> Panda will translate the shader into the ARBVP1/ARBFP1 profile by default, for the reason stated above. If instructions are used that are not supported by these profiles, this error will occur.

<i>Workaround:</i> You need to disable the basic-shaders-only flag to allow Panda to translate the shaders into profiles that do support the used instructions:
<pre class="codeblock">
basic-shaders-only #f
</pre>
Note that by doing so you might run into the problem above, and it is not recommended to do so unless you really need it.

<b>Problem: Untested/Unfinished DirectX Support.</b>

<i>Problem:</i> Shader development is currently being done in OpenGL.  The DirectX support typically lags behind, and is often less fully-tested.

<i>Workaround:</i> The default setting for Panda is to use OpenGL, not DirectX.  For now, when using shaders, do not change this setting.
