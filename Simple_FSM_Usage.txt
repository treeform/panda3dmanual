A Panda3D FSM is implemented by defining a new Python class which inherits from the class direct.fsm.FSM.FSM (normally imported as FSM.FSM or simply FSM), and defining the appropriate enter and exit methods on the class.

FSM states are represented by name strings, which should not
contain spaces or punctuation marks; by Panda3D convention, state
names should begin with a capital letter.  An FSM is always in exactly
one state a time; the name of the current state in stored in
<code>fsm.state</code>.  When it transitions from one state to
another, it first calls <code>exitOldState()</code>, and then it calls
<code>enterNewState()</code>, where OldState is the name of the
previous state, and NewState is the name of the state it is entering.
While it is making this transition, the FSM is not technically in
either state, and <code>fsm.state</code> will be None--but you can
find both old and new state names in <code>fsm.oldState</code> and
<code>fsm.newState</code>, respectively.

To define a possible state for an FSM, you only need to define an
<code>enterStateName()</code> and/or <code>exitStateName()</code>
method on your class, where StateName is the name of the state you
would like to define.  The <code>enterStateName()</code> method should
perform all the necessary action for entering your new state, and the
corresponding <code>exitStateName()</code> method should generally
undo everything that was done in <code>enterStateName()</code>, so
that the world is returned to a neutral state.

An FSM starts and finishes in the state named "Off".  When the FSM
is created, it is already in "Off"; and when you destroy it (by
calling <code>fsm.cleanup()</code>), it automatically transitions back
to "Off".

To request an FSM to transition explicitly to a new state, use the
call <code>fsm.request('StateName')</code> or shorter alias <code>fsm.request_StateName()</code>, where StateName is the
state you would like it to transition to.

<b>Arguments to enterStateName methods</b>

Normally, both <code>enterStateName()</code> and
<code>exitStateName()</code> take no arguments (other than self).
However, if your FSM requires some information before it can
transition to a particular state, you can define any arguments you
like to the enterStateName method for that state; these arguments
should be passed in to the <code>request()</code> call, following the
state name.

<pre class="codeblock">
from direct.fsm import FSM

class AvatarFSM(FSM.FSM):
    def enterWalk(self, speed, doorMask):
        avatar.setPlayRate(speed, 'walk')
        avatar.loop('walk')
        footstepsSound.play()
        enableDoorCollisions(doorMask)
        
    def exitWalk(self):
        avatar.stop()
        footstepsSound.stop()
        disableDoorCollisions()

myfsm = AvatarFSM()
myfsm.request('Walk', 1.0, BitMask32.bit(2))
# or, if you use short syntax
myfsm.request_Walk(1.0, BitMask32.bit(2))
</pre>

Note that the exitStateName method must always take no arguments.

<b>Allowed and disallowed state transitions</b>

By default, every state transition request is allowed: the call
<code>fsm.request('StateName')</code> (or <code>fsm.request_StateName()</code>) will always succeed, and the the
FSM will be left in the new state.  You may wish to make your FSM more
robust by disallowing certain transitions that you don't want to
happen.

For instance, consider the example FSM described previously, which
had the following state diagram:

<center><table style="border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 1pt 0pt">
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><big></big></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; background: #c1beea; padding: 5pt">
Walk2Swim
</td>
<td style="text-align: center"><big></big></td><td></td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; background: #c1beea; padding: 5pt">
Walk
</td>
<td></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; background: #c1beea; padding: 5pt">
Swim
<td></td>
<td><big>&rarr;</big></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; background: #c1beea; padding: 5pt">
Drowning
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center"><big></big></td>
<td style="border: 1px solid black; background: #c1beea; padding: 5pt">
Swim2Walk
</td>
<td style="text-align: center"><big></big></td><td></td><td></td>
</tr>
</table></center>

In this diagram, the arrows represent legal transitions.  It is
legal to transition from 'Walk' to 'Walk2Swim', but not from 'Walk' to
'Swim2Walk'.  If you were to request the FSM to enter state
'Swim2Walk' while it is currently in state 'Walk', that's a bug; you
might prefer to have the FSM throw an exception, so you can find this
bug.

To enforce this, you can store <code>self.defaultTransitions</code>
in the FSM's <code>__init__()</code> method.  This should be a map of
allowed transitions from each state.  That is, each key of the map is
a state name; for that key, the value is a list of allowed transitions
from the indicated state.  Any transition not listed in
defaultTransitions is considered invalid.  For example:

<pre class="codeblock">
class AvatarFSM(FSM.FSM):
    def __init__(self):
        FSM.FSM.__init__(self)
        self.defaultTransitions = {
            'Walk' : [ 'Walk2Swim' ],
            'Walk2Swim' : [ 'Swim' ],
            'Swim' : [ 'Swim2Walk', 'Drowning' ],
            'Swim2Walk' : [ 'Walk' ],
            'Drowning' : [ ],
            }
</pre>

If you do not assign anything to self.defaultTransitions, then all
transitions are legal.  However, if you <em>do</em> assign a map like
the above, then requesting a transition that is not listed in the map
will raise the exception <code>FSM.RequestDenied</code>.
