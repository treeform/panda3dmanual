This section lists a number of tools to support programming in Panda.

Many of the tools provided are invoked by pressing a
hot-key inside of the panda main window.  These hot-key driven tools
are called the "direct tools."  The direct tools are initially disabled,
because the hot-keys used to invoke them might interfere with the program's
own keys and events.

To enable the hot-keys for the direct tools, you
need to set the 'want-directtools' variable in config.prc, the main
panda configuration file.  Additionally, set 'want-tk' to '#t' in order to enable the Direct Session Panel. More information about this configuration
file is available in the [[Configuring Panda]] section.

If you want to quickly enable the Direct Session browser, add the following code <i>before</i> importing DirectStart:
<pre class="codeblock">
from pandac.PandaModules import loadPrcFileData
loadPrcFileData("", "want-directtools #t")
loadPrcFileData("", "want-tk #t")
</pre>

After enabling direct tools and starting panda, the
Direct Session window should appear:
