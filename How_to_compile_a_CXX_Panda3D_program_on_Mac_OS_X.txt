[cxx]This short guide explains how to build a Panda3D game written in C++ game under Mac OS. 

Mac OS comes with python installed, however because of production cycles your version may be a bit outdated, if you want to download the latest python version, you can go to the [http://www.python.org/download/ Python] website. Just make sure that the Panda3D version is compatible with it.

In order to compile you need also to have the <b>GNU G++ compiler</b>.  Unlike in Linux, the G++ compiler is not pre-installed in Mac OS X, you will need to install <b>Xcode development tools</b>, the installer comes in the Mac OS installer CDs or DVDs, however for newer versions, you can download it from its [http://developer.apple.com/ website]. You will need to register for an account.

Having these two components, we can proceed to compile: 

First we must create <b>.o</b> file from our cxx file. We need to link to the Panda3D include files and to the Python include files. 

<code bash>g++ -c filename.cxx -o filename.o -fPIC -O2 -I{pythoninclude} -I{panda3dinclude} </code>

Please change the paths in these commands to the appropiate locations. A list of locations is at the end of the page.

Secondly, we need to generate an executable, you can use the following command: 

<code bash>g++ filename.o -o filename -fPIC -L{panda3dlibs} -lp3framework -lpanda      -lpandafx -lpandaexpress -lp3dtoolconfig -lp3dtool -lp3pystub -lp3direct </code>

As mentioned above, we need to change the paths accordingly, the paths for Mac OS are listed below:

•	{pythoninclude}: The path to your Python include folder. For version 2.5, this is <b>/usr/include/python2.5 </b>by default. 

•	{panda3dinclude}: Change this to the path to your Panda3D include directory. This would probably look like <b>/Applications/Panda3D/1.6.2/include/ </b>in the case of 1.6.2 but this applies for all versions.

•	{panda3dlibs}: Change this to the path to your Panda3D libraries. This is <b>/Applications/Panda3D/1.6.2/lib  </b>in the case of 1.6.2 but this applies for all versions.

And lastly to run the created executable, type:
 
<code bash>./filename</code>
