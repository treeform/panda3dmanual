Pview or Panda Viewer is a model and animation viewer for egg and bam files. This allows users to see if their files have converted correctly without having to create a Panda3D program. Pview is accessed through a command prompt.

To view a model that has been converted to an egg or bam file, type the following:

<table class="code"><tr><td>
pview modelFile.egg
</td></tr></table>

To view a character model with animations, simply add the name of the file with the animation.

<table class="code"><tr><td>
pview modelFile.egg animationFile.egg
</td></tr></table>

Here's an example based on the panda model distributed with panda source.

<table class="code"><tr><td>
pview panda
</td></tr></table>

A new window should pop-up and here's what you should see -

There are some controls and hotkeys available while using pview. To see the whole list press shift-question mark in the pview window. To turn this list off press shift-question mark again. For convenience here is the full list of as the time of writing:

<table>
<tr><td>Left-click and drag Mouse</td><td>Moves the model up, down, left, and right relative to the camera</td></tr>
<tr><td>Middle-click and drag Mouse</td><td>Rotates the model around its pivot</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right-click and drag Mouse</td><td>Moves the model away and towards the camera</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td><td>Report framerate. The current framerate is output on the console window.</td></tr>

As of this writing there is a small caveat in loading textures for models into pview. Textures are searched for relative to the directory that pview is called from, not the directory that the model is in. Either make sure that the texture path is set correctly in the Config.prc file or ensure the bam or egg file look for the textures correctly (relative to where you are calling pview). The easiest way to get around this is to call pview from the directory that the model is placed.
