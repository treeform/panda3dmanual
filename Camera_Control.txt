Panda3D's camera is considered a PandaNode.  It can therefore be manipulated as any other node.

The actual camera is defined in ShowBase as a NodePath named <code>base.cam</code>.  There is also a plain node above the camera, which is a NodePath called <code>base.camera</code>.  Generally you want to control the <code>base.camera</code> NodePath with your code.
