Before you can create any geometry in Panda3D, you must have a valid
[[GeomVertexFormat|<b>GeomVertexFormat</b>]].  You can decide exactly which columns you want to
have in your format, by building the format up one column at a time.
(But you might be able to avoid this effort by taking advantage of one of the [[Pre-defined vertex formats|pre-defined formats]] listed on the next page.)

To build up your custom format, you need to first create an empty <b>GeomVertexArrayFormat</b>,
and add columns one at a time by calling addColumn():

<pre class="codeblock">
array = GeomVertexArrayFormat()
array.addColumn(InternalName.make('vertex'), 3, 
                Geom.NTFloat32, Geom.CPoint)
</pre>

The parameters to addColumn() are, in order, the column name, the
number of components, the numeric type, and the contents
specification.  See [[GeomVertexFormat]] for a detailed description of
each of these parameters and their appropriate values.  You may also
supply an optional fifth parameter, which specifies the byte offset
within the row at which the column's data begins; but normally you
should omit this to indicate that the column's data immediately
follows the previous column's data.

Note that the column name should be an <b>InternalName</b> object, as
returned by a call to InternalName.make().  This is Panda's
mechanism for tokenizing a string name, to allow for fast name lookups
during rendering.  Other than this detail, the column name is really just an arbitrary string.

It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the parameters passed
to addColumn() are appropriate for the column you are defining.  The column data will be stored exactly as you specify.  When
rendering, Panda will attempt to convert the column data as it is stored to whatever format your graphics API (e.g. OpenGL or DirectX)
expects to receive.

For instance, to define a vertex format that includes a vertex
position and a (U, V) texture coordinate:

<pre class="codeblock">
array = GeomVertexArrayFormat()
array.addColumn(InternalName.make('vertex'), 3, 
                Geom.NTFloat32, Geom.CPoint)
array.addColumn(InternalName.make('texcoord'), 2, 
                Geom.NTFloat32, Geom.CTexcoord)
</pre>

Once you have defined the columns of your array, you should create a
GeomVertexFormat to hold the array:

<pre class="codeblock">
format = GeomVertexFormat()
format.addArray(array)
</pre>

If you want your format to consist of multiple different arrays, you
can create additional arrays and add them at this point as well.

Finally, before you can use your new format, you must <i>register</i>
it.  Registering a format builds up the internal tables necessary to
use the vertex format for rendering.  However, once you have
registered a format, you can no longer add or remove columns, or
modify it in any way; if you want to make changes to the format after
this point, you'll have to start over with a new GeomVertexFormat
object.

<pre class="codeblock">
format = GeomVertexFormat.registerFormat(format)
</pre>

You should always register a format with a syntax similar to the
above: that is, you should use the return value of registerFormat as
your new, registered format object, and discard the original format
object.  (The returned format object may be the same format object you
started with, or it may be a different object with an equivalent
meaning.  Either way, the format object you started with should be
discarded.)
