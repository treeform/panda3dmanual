<b>Explanation</b>

This sample program shows planets orbiting around the sun, and a moon orbiting one of the planets.  If you just stare at the moon, you'll realize that its motion is a spiral:

The motion of the moon is only simple if you think about it in relative terms: the moon is moving in a circle <i>relative</i> to the planet, and the planet is moving in a circle <i>relative</i> to the sun.

This panda program shows how to implement relative movement and relative positioning.
