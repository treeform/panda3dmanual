Underpinning Panda's networking capabilities are the classes that compose the datagram protocol. These classes allow for developer-defined packets to be transmitted using either the UDP or TCP protocols. Panda's datagram layer can serve as a solid foundation for developing higher-level networking abstractions.

This section describes the classes used to establish a connection (QueuedConnectionManager,QueuedConnectionListener, QueuedConnectionReader, and ConnectionWriter), as well as the classes that transmit information (NetDatagram, PyDatagram, and PyDatagramIterator).
