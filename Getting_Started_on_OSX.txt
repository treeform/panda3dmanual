Congratulations! You've installed Panda3D on your machine. Now, what next?

First of all, you should [[General Preparation|prepare]] by learning Python. You can also use C++ with Panda3D, but since most of its users use Python, and it is a very easy language to master, Python is the most recommended choice.

Then, you can dive into the [[Main Page|Manual]] and try the Hello World samples. The manual is a great resource for learning Panda3D and getting in-depth information about various subjects. However, for more concrete examples, you can dive into the [[Sample Programs]], which ship with the Panda3D build.


<h1>Running the Sample Programs</h1>
Panda3D comes with a handful of Sample Programs, which are stored in /Applications/Panda3D/1.6.0/samples. After opening a terminal window navigate to the directory of the sample program you want to see.

Then, you can run the program by using the 'python' command:
<pre class="codeblock">python Tut-Asteroids.py</pre>


<h1>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h1>
<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i><br>dyld: Library not loaded: @executable_path/../Library/Frameworks/Cg.framework/Cg
<br>Referenced from: /Applications/Panda3D/1.6.0/lib/libpanda.dylib
<br>Reason: image not found
<br>Trace/BPT trap</i>

This means you need to download and install the [http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cg_toolkit.html#downloads NVIDIA Cg Toolkit] before you will be able to use Panda3D.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i><br>Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
<br>Abort trap</i>

You are running a version of Python that is not compatible with the version Panda3D has been compiled with. However, OSX always ships with a system version of Python that should be compatible. The fact that it doesn't work simply indicating that the wrong copy of python is ran.

You need to make sure you are running Apple's version of Python. Fortunately, Panda3D ships with a file called 'ppython' that is a mere symlink to /usr/bin/python, where Apple's copy of Python resides. So, instead of 'python', you should call 'ppython'.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i><br>Warning: DirectNotify: category 'Interval' already exists</i>

This error is of no consequence.  Ignore it.

<b>What to do if you see the Error Message:</b>
<i>
<br>display(error): The application requested harware acceleration, but your OpenGL
<br>display(error): driver, GDI Generic, only supports software rendering.
<br>display(error): You need to install a hardware-accelerated OpenGL driver, or,
<br>display(error): if you actually *want* to use a software renderer, then
<br>display(error): alter the hardware/software configuration in your Config.prc file.
<br>display(error): Window wouldn't open; abandoning window.

This error is fairly self-explanatory: it means your video drivers are inadequate. Obtain updated drivers by running Software Update or, if you have installed a 3rd party video card, installing new drivers from the video card vendor.

Alternatively, you can use Panda3D in software rendering mode, You will not be able to use fancy shaders and it will be much slower than in hardware mode. However, if you still want to use it, you need to edit your Config.prc file (which can be found in the "etc" dir of your Panda3D installation) and find this line:
<pre class="codeblock">load-display pandagl</pre>
Replace that line with this instead:
<pre class="codeblock">load-display tinydisplay</pre>
