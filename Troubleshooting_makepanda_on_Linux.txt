This page describes potential build issues that may arise when building Panda3D using the Makepanda build system on the Linux platform, and possible solutions.

<h2>Undefined reference to `__isoc99_sscanf'</h2>

If you're building Panda3D on 64-bits linux, and run into this error:
<pre class="codeblock">g++ -o built/bin/apply_patch -Lbuilt/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib built/tmp/apply_patch_apply_patch.o
-lpanda -lpandaexpress -lp3dtool -lp3dtoolconfig -lp3pystub -lz -lssl -lpthread -ldl
built/lib/libpanda.so: undefined reference to `__isoc99_sscanf'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>
This error is related to the ffmpeg thirdparty package, which has been compiled with a very recent version of glibc. You either need to upgrade your system's glibc version (recommended) or you can compile with --no-ffmpeg .
